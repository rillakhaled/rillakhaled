I am an associate professor at the [Department of Design and Computation Arts](https://www.concordia.ca/finearts/design.html) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), and [Director of the Technoculture, Art, and Games (TAG) Research Centre](http://tag.hexagram.ca/). I have a PhD in Computer Science from the [Victoria University of Wellington](http://www.victoria.ac.nz/home/) in New Zealand. My research focuses on how to design more effective and meaningful serious and persuasive games, speculative play, the interactions between games, gamification, and culture, participatory game design, and game design and AI. My previous PhD research focused on culturally-relevant persuasive games, and established that designing for cultural relevance leads to greater persuasion. As my background is in software engineering and cross-cultural psychology, my interests extend from the software-level design and development of games up to their higher level effects on and as cultural practices.
